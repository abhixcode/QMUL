Implement a function that receives a ``DataFrame`` of frequent itemsets and a **strong** association rule (represented by a ``frozenset`` of antecedents and a ``frozenset`` of consequents). This function should return the corresponding Kulczynski measure. Include the code in your report. [1 mark out of 5]\n","8.
